 â”œâ”€â”€ Accessibility     # Helpers and A11y configurations
 â”œâ”€â”€ Models            # Data structures
 â”œâ”€â”€ Resources         # Assets, colors, localization files
 â”œâ”€â”€ Utilities         # Reusable helper functions
 â”œâ”€â”€ ViewModels        # UI logic and state management

ðŸš€ How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SwiftUIAccessibilityDemo.git
 	2.	Open the .xcodeproj file in Xcode.
	3.	Set the Team to your own account in Signing & Capabilities (currently set to None for portability).
	4.	Build & run on simulator or device.

 ðŸ’¡ Why This Project Stands Out
	â€¢	Code is clean, modular, and well-commented.
	â€¢	Accessibility is not an afterthought â€” itâ€™s integrated from the start.
	â€¢	Uses semantic design to ensure adaptability to any userâ€™s needs.
	â€¢	Ready for localization and scalable features.

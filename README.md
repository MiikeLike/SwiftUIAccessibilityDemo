## 🚀 How to Run  
```bash
# Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SwiftUIAccessibilityDemo.git

```

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out  
- **Clean**, modular, and well-commented code.  
- Accessibility is **not an afterthought** — it’s integrated from the start.  
- Uses **semantic design** to ensure adaptability to any user’s needs.  
- Ready for **localization** and **scalable features**.

# SwiftUI Accessibility Demo  
*ðŸš€ Technical Test â€” Accessibility-focused iOS App*

## ðŸ“‹ Overview  
This is a SwiftUI iOS application developed as part of a technical test, showcasing accessibility best practices aligned with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.  
The app demonstrates how to create inclusive, scalable, and user-friendly interfaces with features that ensure everyone can interact with it effectively.

| Touch Target Size  | Minimum 44Ã—44 pt tap areas for all interactive elements.   |
| Gesture Alternatives | Button-based fallbacks for gesture-only actions.          |
| Reduce Motion Support | Animations adapt to userâ€™s motion preferences.           |

## ðŸš€ How to Run  
```bash
# Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SwiftUIAccessibilityDemo.git

# Open the .xcodeproj file in Xcode.

# Set the Team to your own account in Signing & Capabilities (currently set to None for portability).

# Build & run on simulator or device.
```

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Project Stands Out  
- **Clean**, modular, and well-commented code.  
- Accessibility is **not an afterthought** â€” itâ€™s integrated from the start.  
- Uses **semantic design** to ensure adaptability to any userâ€™s needs.  
- Ready for **localization** and **scalable features**.
